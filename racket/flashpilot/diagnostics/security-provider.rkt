;; Security Provider abstraction: vendor seed-key algorithms beyond the
;; registered derivers plug in as external commands. A provider is named
;; `command:<id>` in driver settings; BenchPilot runs
;;   <executable> <args...> --seed <hex>
;; and parses the stdout as the key hex. Vendor code stays in the vendor's
;; own binary — Core only sees bytes.
