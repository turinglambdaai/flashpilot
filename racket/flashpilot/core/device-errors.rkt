;; Device/runtime error taxonomy: vendor SDK messages are classified into a
;; small, stable set of classes without ever leaking vendor types or vendor
;; SDK details into Core. Faulted operations carry a `device.error` evidence
;; item whose metadata names the class and the pattern that matched, so
;; agents can branch on behavior instead of parsing vendor strings.
