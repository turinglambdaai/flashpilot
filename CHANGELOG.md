# Changelog

All notable changes to FlashPilot are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning is SemVer.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **UDS over LIN (simulated)** — `--transport lin` plus
  `flashpilot/diagnostics/isotp/lin-{tp,endpoint}.rkt` and
  `channels/lin-uds-channel.rkt`: ISO 17987-3 style diagnostic framing
  (0x3C/0x3D, NAD + PCI, 6-byte windows, master-paced, no flow control).
  The full flash workflow runs against the simulated ECU over LIN in CI.
  Hardware LIN adapters (PLIN/Kvaser) are future work.
- Fixed a latent simulated-bus race: an empty inbox initialized as `'()`
  (truthy) could crash a transport pump that polled before the first
  frame arrived; inboxes now start as `#f`.

- **CAN FD support** — plans accept `"dataLength"` (8 classic default; snaps
  to the nearest legal FD length up to 64). ISO-TP codec, endpoints and the
  simulated ECU chunk frames at the configured data length; SocketCAN gains
  `canfd_frame` wire support and enables `CAN_RAW_FD_FRAMES` in FD mode.
  Classic CAN behavior is bit-identical; PCAN FD waits on hardware
  verification. `examples/plan.sim-fd.json` flashes the simulated ECU over
  FD in CI.

- **ODX import (subset)** — `odx-import` command plus
  `flashpilot/diagnostics/flash/odx`: `.odx`/`.odx-f`/`.pdx` into flash
  plans (MEMORY-SEGMENT ranges, inline base64 DATA, DATAFILE references).
  Everything outside the subset is reported in `issues`, never dropped.
  CDD/VFD remain out of scope by design.
- **Plan validation lint** — `validate` command plus
  `flashpilot/diagnostics/flash/validation`: segment overlap (error),
  empty segments (warning), gaps (warning), missing data/file (error);
  `flash` refuses plans with validation errors.
- **MCP server** — `app/mcp.rkt`: stdio JSON-RPC 2.0 exposing
  `flashpilot_validate`, `flashpilot_flash`, `flashpilot_request`,
  `flashpilot_udid` and `flashpilot_odx_import` to coding agents;
  `scripts/mcp-smoke.rkt` gates the surface in CI.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-14

First release. CLI-first, three platforms: the flashing core, a declarative
plan format and an agent-first CLI — no GUI in the release artifacts (the
native shells stay in-repo as a debug cockpit).

### Added

- **UDS (ISO 14229) core** — P2/P2* timing, NRC taxonomy, DTC read/clear
  (0x19 / 0x14), DID read (0x22), TesterPresent, ECU reset.
- **UDS flash workflow** — session → security access → erase → download →
  verify → reset, with a per-step audit on every run.
- **Declarative flash plans** — one JSON document per ECU: segments (inline
  hex or raw BIN files), session, security level, key deriver,
  recovery strategy (`retry` / `resetAndRetry`), in-programming power guard,
  and an `expectedFingerprint` gate validated before any driver call.
  Intel HEX / S-record parsing ships in the image model.
- **Security providers** — built-in seed-key derivers plus pluggable external
  algorithms via `command:<id>`; vendor code stays in vendor binaries.
- **Transports** — SocketCAN (Linux), PEAK PCAN (Windows), DoIP (Ethernet);
  ISO-TP (ISO 15765-2) underneath. UDS over LIN is planned, not in this release.
- **Built-in simulated ECU** — a real ISO-TP/UDS stack answering behind a
  simulated CAN bus, so the entire flash loop runs hardware-free, including CI.
- **Agent-first CLI** — `flash` / `verify` / `dtc` / `request` / `udid`;
  deterministic single-line JSON output, stable exit codes (0 ok · 1
  flash/assert failed · 2 usage · 3 not found · 4 transport), bounded failure
  evidence so an agent can diagnose and retry without a vendor tool.
- **User guide** — bilingual (Chinese/English) manual at
  <https://flashpilot.jrtx.site/guide.html>.
- **Release engineering** — tagged builds produce per-platform CLI archives
  (zip + SHA-256) and a combined SHA256SUMS on GitHub Releases.
